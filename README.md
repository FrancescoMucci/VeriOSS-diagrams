# Diagrams made for the VeriOSS smart contract development project

This repository contains sequence, class and state diagrams related to the **VeriOSS smart contract development** project whose goal is to design, develop and formally verify the Solidity smart contract responsible for the partial reward process of the bounty claim protocol, an instance of a two-party fair exchange protocol, of VeriOSS, a blockchain-based bug bounty platform.

Every diagram is realized using [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net): an open source, online, desktop and container deployable diagramming software.
